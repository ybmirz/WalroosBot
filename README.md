# WalroosBot
A custom discord bot made for the Minecraft server I'm currently managing, [Aquacraft](https://aquacraft.ca/). It's a grind-worthy cracked Minecraft server, built by grinders, for grinders, with gamemodes such as OP Survival, Skyblock and Minigames. Learn more about us [here!](https://aquacraft.ca/about/)

The bot basically is a side project to help moderate, manage and work with our discord server. This bot has commands specifically for staff members to manage roles, etc. Basically a purpose-built discord bot for our server. If you saw this, and you'd like one of your own custom purpose-built bots for your own server, you could contact me on discord: 
`xeno#3125`

This bot utilizes Firestore DB from Google as a database. This bot was made using DSharpPlus.

## Basic Functions:
- **Suggestions**: Users are able to simply make a suggestion and staff members could decide on said suggestions. Users are notified through DMs during decisions and suggestion making. Users can also edit their suggestions for better or for worse.
- **Giveaways**: Basic Giveaway for users to start their own giveaway, with options for users to `end`,`reroll`, and `cancel` their giveaways.
- **Ticketter**: Ticketting system to assist staff members when tickets are made on the discord server. The bot simply lets players/ticket-openers to choose a variety of options and will return back a form that they fill in, along with renaming the channel to the appropriate topic as chosen; Helpful during high-ticketting times for staff members to deal with.
- **Role-Granting**: WalroosBot can also grant specific roles on command. For now, only a `Verified` Role Grant is used on our discord for security.
- **Fun Cmds**: Ample Amount of Fun commands for our players that just wanna cool off or make a bet, such as: `8ball`, `coinflip`, `diceroll`, `rps`, `choose`.
- **Convert**: Has the ability to convert strings when needed, as of right now, is used for custom tag making on our server, such as converting `JSON → EssentialsChat Format` and `EssentialsChat Format → RAW Format`.
- **Firestarter**: Pings a dedicated `Firestarter` Role in chat, to revive a dead chat, with a set (2h) cooldown to not be abused with.
- **Bump Reminder**: Detects when a `DISBOARD` Bump is done, and will remind a specific role when the timer is over, to re-bump our server on the `DISBOARD` List.
- **Announcer**: Create announcements set over a time interval for the bot to announce, in a specific channel.
